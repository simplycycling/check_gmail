# Check Gmail

I use Mutt as an email client. Mutt is a small, but very powerful text-based
email client for Unix operating systems. It's very fully featured, but I'm
using gmail, and I was resorting to opening Mutt to see if I had any new email.
A clumsy and inefficient method of doing so, IMO. So I wrote Check Gmail to
check gmail for me.

Just a simple script to check a gmail account, to see if there is any unread
email. If there is, you will get a Gnome notification. This assumes you are
using Gnome.
